    "By carefully observing the results, we can infer that, even though the test accuracy is high (84.6%), the precision and recall of one category (Attrition = Yes) is low (precision = 0.39 and recall = 0.20). This could be a serious issue when management tries to use this model to provide some extra benefits proactively to the employees with a high chance of attrition prior to actual attrition, as this model is unable to identify the real employees who will be leaving. Hence, we need to look for other modifications; one way is to control the model by using class weights. By utilizing class weights, we can increase the importance of a particular class at the cost of an increase in other errors.\n",
